This repo contains the Halo2 implementation for the Anon-Aadhaar protocol.
At this point, the main components are :-
1. Verification of an RSA signature of a SHA-256 hashed message.
2. Extraction of fields from signed data. If reveal true: age > 18, gender, state, pincode. 
3. Conversion of IST timestamp to UTC UNIX timestamp.
4. Apply constraints on the signal hash. 

How to build and run the repo:
1. cargo update -p half@2.4.1 --precise 2.2.0
2. cargo build
3. cargo test
